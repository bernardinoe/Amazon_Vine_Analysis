## Summary: In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
After reviewing the data for the Vine program, the results show that only less than 75K reviews are 5 stars, out of the total of more than 5.3 million reviews. I would consider reducing the parameters of the analysis. I would decrease total votes to no more than 5, as there may be new reviews that are helpful but because of time they dont have enough votes. Additionally, i would include 4 stars into the analisis, as it could represent a bigger number of satisfied customers. With this new data, we can see if the results are the same as for what we just analyzed.
